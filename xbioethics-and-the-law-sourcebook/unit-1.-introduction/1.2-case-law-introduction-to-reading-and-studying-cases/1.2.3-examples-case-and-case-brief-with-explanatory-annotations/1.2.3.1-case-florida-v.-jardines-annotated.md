Supreme Court of the United States

Florida v. Joelis Jardines

What are these names, and why are they in this order? [hashtag](1.2.3.1-case-florida-v.-jardines-annotated.md#what-are-these-names-and-why-are-they-in-this-order)

The party before the "v." was the "loser" in the court below (appellants/petitioners). The party after the "v." are appellees/respondents. Being listed before or after the 'v.' does not indicate who was the plaintiff or defendant in the trial court.

Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.

We consider whether using a drug-sniffing dog on a homeowner's porch to investigate the contents of the home is a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

About a court's statement of facts and procedural history

Courts usually describe key facts early and explain procedural history (how the case reached the court and who won below). Facts often determine the outcome; some facts may appear later in analysis.

In 2006, Detective William Pedraja received an unverified tip that marijuana was being grown in respondent Joelis Jardines's home. One month later, the Miami-Dade Police Department and the Drug Enforcement Administration sent a joint surveillance team. Detective Pedraja watched the home for fifteen minutes, saw no vehicles or activity, and could not see inside because the blinds were drawn.

Detective Pedraja then approached Jardines' home with Detective Douglas Bartelt, a trained canine handler who had just arrived with his drug-sniffing dog. The dog was trained to detect marijuana, cocaine, heroin, and other drugs, indicating presence by behavioral changes the handler recognized.

Detective Bartelt had the dog on a six-foot leash; the dog had a tendency to dart around erratically while searching. As the dog approached Jardines' front porch, it apparently detected an odor it had been trained to detect and began energetically exploring the area for the strongest source of that odor—"bracketing," back and forth. Detective Bartelt gave the dog "the full six feet of the leash plus whatever safe distance \[he could] give him." Detective Pedraja stood back so he would not "get knocked over" while the dog was searching.

After sniffing the base of the front door, the dog sat—the trained behavior for discovering the odor's strongest point. Detective Bartelt then pulled the dog away and returned to his vehicle, leaving the scene after informing Detective Pedraja of a positive alert for narcotics.

On that basis, Detective Pedraja applied for and received a warrant to search the residence. When executed later that day, Jardines attempted to flee and was arrested; the search revealed marijuana plants, and he was charged with trafficking in cannabis.

At trial, Jardines moved to suppress the marijuana plants on the ground that the canine investigation was an unreasonable search. The trial court granted the motion. The Florida Third District Court of Appeal reversed. The Florida Supreme Court quashed the Third District and approved suppression, holding that the use of the trained narcotics dog to investigate Jardines' home was a Fourth Amendment search unsupported by probable cause, rendering invalid the warrant.

We granted certiorari, limited to whether the officers' behavior was a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.

Portions highlighted in yellow in the original are statements of the rule(s) the Court will apply in analysis.
{% endhint %}

The Fourth Amendment provides that the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated." When "the Government obtains information by physically intruding" on persons, houses, papers, or effects, "a 'search' within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment" has "undoubtedly occurred." (United States v. Jones, 565 U.S. 400 (2012).) Katz v. United States (1967) added the reasonable-expectation-of-privacy test but did not subtract from the Amendment's protections when the Government physically intrudes on a protected area.

Here, officers gathered information in an area belonging to Jardines and immediately surrounding his house—the curtilage—which our cases treat as part of the home itself. They gathered that information by physically entering and occupying the area to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner.

{% hint style="info" %}
The preceding paragraph is analytical: the officers' conduct occurred within a constitutionally protected area and was investigatory.
{% endhint %}

A

The Fourth Amendment "indicates with some precision the places and things encompassed by its protections": persons, houses, papers, and effects. (Oliver v. United States, 466 U.S. 170 (1984).) The Amendment does not prevent all investigations on private property; for example, officers may gather information in "open fields" even if privately owned (Hester v. United States, 1924). But the home holds special status: at the Amendment's "very core" stands the right to retreat into one's home free from unreasonable governmental intrusion (Silverman v. United States, 1961).

The area immediately surrounding the home—the curtilage—is "part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes" (Oliver). This area is "intimately linked to the home" and where privacy expectations are most heightened (California v. Ciraolo, 1986). Here, there is no doubt the officers entered the curtilage: the front porch is a classic exemplar of an area adjacent to the home to which home life extends.

B

Since the investigation occurred in a constitutionally protected area, the Court asked whether it was accomplished through an unlicensed physical intrusion. Officers need not "shield their eyes" when passing by homes on public thoroughfares (Ciraolo), but stepping off such thoroughfares into protected areas is sharply circumscribed. Entick v. Carrington (1765) expresses the common-law rule that no one may set foot on another's close without leave. The detectives here had all four feet (and the dog's) planted on Jardines' porch; the question is whether Jardines implicitly gave leave. He did not.

A license may be implied from social habits—e.g., the knocker on the front door is treated as an invitation or license to approach to knock, wait briefly, and then leave (Breard v. Alexandria). This implied license generally permits approach for the ordinary purposes of a visitor. A police officer not armed with a warrant may approach and knock because that is "no more than any private citizen might do" (Kentucky v. King).

But introducing a trained police dog to explore the area around the home in hopes of discovering incriminating evidence is not within that customary invitation. There is no customary invitation to conduct canine forensic investigation by approaching the front door. The scope of any implied license is limited to particular area and purpose; background social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not invite that visitor to conduct a search.

\[...]

Here, the question is whether the officers' conduct was an objectively reasonable search. That depends on whether the officers had an implied license to enter the porch, which in turn depends on the purpose for which they entered. Their behavior objectively revealed a purpose to conduct a search, which is not within the implied license.

III

The State argued that investigation by a forensic narcotics dog cannot implicate any legitimate privacy interest, citing cases where canine inspection of luggage at an airport, chemical testing of a substance fallen from a parcel in transit, and canine inspection of an automobile during a lawful traffic stop do not violate Katz's "reasonable expectation of privacy."

In Jones (2012), the Court held that mounting a GPS receiver on a vehicle was a Fourth Amendment search because the Government physically intruded on the defendant's effects. The Katz standard has been added to, not substituted for, the property-based understanding; when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas, the property baseline suffices.

Thus, the Court need not decide whether the officers' investigation violated privacy expectations under Katz. The officers learned what they learned only by physically intruding on Jardines' property to gather evidence; that is enough to establish that a search occurred.

\[...]

The government's use of trained police dogs to investigate the home and its immediate surroundings is a "search" within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. The judgment of the Supreme Court of Florida is therefore affirmed.

The holding above is the Court's holding.

It is so ordered.
