Immersive Reader in Microsoft Forms allows you to hear the text of a form title and questions read out loud while following along. You can find the Immersive Reader button next to the form title or questions after activating this control. You can also change the spacing of lines and words to make them easier to read, highlight parts of speech and syllables, select single words or lines of words read aloud, and select language preferences.

When you submit this form, it will not automatically collect your details like name and email address unless you provide it yourself.
