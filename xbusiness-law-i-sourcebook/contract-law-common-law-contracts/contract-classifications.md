# Contract Classifications

I've removed the navigation links you provided because they're not part of the page's main content. There wasn't any other content to convert.

If you want, paste the main body content of the page (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, images, etc.) and I'll convert it into GitBook-optimized Markdown using tabs, steppers, expandables, hints, etc., as appropriate.
