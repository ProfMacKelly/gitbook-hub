# Modern Legal Systems of the World

There are four main legal systems in the modern world:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
### Common law

* Written judicial decisions of appellate courts are binding legal authority on lower courts when interpreting and applying the same or similar questions of law.
* The legal system is adversarial.
* The outcome of a case is often decided by a jury of the parties’ peers.

The legal system in the United States comes from the English common law tradition and the US Constitution. English common law is a system that gives written judicial decisions the force of law. As a result, the US legal system recognizes an appellate court’s ability to interpret and apply the law to future litigants through precedent. Precedent is a judicial opinion that is considered legal authority for future cases involving the same or similar questions of law. The benefit of this system is consistency and resolution of disputes without requiring the parties to take legal matters to court.

A famous example of how precedent works is the US Supreme Court case Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954). The Justices unanimously ruled that racial segregation of children in public schools is unconstitutional. Brown v. Board of Education required all racially segregated public schools to integrate and has been cited as legal precedent in thousands of cases nationwide involving racial equality.

The common law legal system is adversarial. Parties bring their cases to the court for resolution; the judge or jury hears evidence and arguments before making a final decision. It is the parties’ burden to investigate facts, argue the law, and present their best case. Judges and juries do not conduct independent investigations nor assist the parties in arguing their cases. Parties must raise all legal issues.

Another characteristic of common law systems is the frequent use of juries of the parties’ peers in both civil and criminal matters. When a jury determines the outcome, the judge acts as a gatekeeper—deciding what evidence and legal arguments the jury can consider and ensuring a fair trial.

The common law tradition is found in England, the United States, and former British colonies. Variations exist (e.g., whether judiciaries may declare legislative acts unconstitutional, or the frequency of jury use), but all recognize precedent and differ from civil law systems that rely on comprehensive legislative codes.

### Civil law

* All legal rules are in comprehensive legislative enactments often called Codes.
* Written judicial decisions of appellate courts are not binding legal authority.
* The legal system is inquisitorial.

Civil law systems were developed in Europe and are based on Roman and Napoleonic law. They are often called code systems because legal rules are contained in one or more comprehensive legislative enactments (codes). During Napoleon’s reign, a comprehensive book of laws (a code) was developed for France, covering criminal and non-criminal law, procedure, and commercial law. Courts resolve cases brought before them, usually decided by judges without juries.

Civil law systems are inquisitorial: judges actively investigate cases, can request documents and testimony, and may shape the parties’ legal claims. Judges are not required to follow other courts’ decisions in similar cases. The legislature, not the courts, is the primary body for enacting and modifying laws.

Civil law systems are used throughout Europe, Central and South America, Asia, and Africa—often introduced by colonial powers such as France, Germany, Holland, Spain, and Portugal.

Communist and socialist legal systems differ significantly and may be considered a separate type or a subset of civil law systems. In such systems, most property may be government- or cooperatively-owned and the judiciary often lacks independence from the ruling party.

### Religious law

* Religious documents are used as legal sources.
* All major world religions have a religious legal system.
* Most nations that have religious legal systems use them to supplement a secular national system.

Religious law systems arise from sacred texts and usually apply to many aspects of life, including social and business relations. All major world religions—Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and Hinduism—have associated religious legal traditions. The Islamic legal system (Sharia), with Islamic jurisprudence (Fiqh), is the most widely used religious legal system globally. Most nations with religious legal systems use them to supplement a secular national system. Only Saudi Arabia (Islamic) and the Vatican (Christian) are pure theocracies with only a religious legal system.

### Customary law (monarchy/tribal systems)

* Legal system used by a monarchy or tribe.
* Grants specific legal powers to kings, queens, sultans, or tribal leaders as heads of state.
* Monarchs and leaders often seen to be “above the law.”

Customary legal systems are becoming increasingly less common. They grant rulers specific legal powers and often place the ruler above the law. Only a handful of monarchies remain, and most have evolved into hybrid systems or adopted other legal systems.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Hybrid law

* Combination of two or more legal systems within a nation.

As the world becomes more interdependent, hybrid legal systems—combinations of two or more legal systems—have developed. India is a classic example: as a former British colony it has a common law tradition (binding judicial precedent through Supreme Court and High Courts) but also uses integrated codes from a civil law tradition and maintains separate personal codes for Muslims, Christians, and Hindus. Thus India’s system combines common law, civil law, and religious law elements.

**Common Law Systems**

The legal system in the United States comes from the English common law tradition and the US Constitution. English common law gives written judicial decisions the force of law; appellate courts can create precedent binding on lower courts for similar legal questions. Precedent promotes consistency and can resolve disputes without requiring litigation in every instance.

Common law is adversarial: parties present evidence and arguments to a judge or jury, and it is the parties’ duty to investigate facts and make legal arguments. Judges and juries do not perform independent investigations.

Cases are often decided by juries of peers in both civil and criminal matters. Judges act as gatekeepers, ensuring fairness and admissibility of evidence and arguments.

Common law systems are unique to England, the United States, and many former British colonies; all recognize precedent and typically do not rely solely on legislative codes as in civil law systems.

**Civil Law Systems**

Civil law systems originate in Roman and Napoleonic law and emphasize comprehensive legislative codes. Judges typically decide cases without juries and are not bound by prior appellate decisions. Civil law is inquisitorial: judges actively investigate and shape proceedings. The legislature is the primary lawmaking body.

Civil law systems are widespread in Europe, Central and South America, Asia, and Africa, often introduced by colonial powers. Communist/socialist systems may be distinct or a subset of civil law systems, characterized by state ownership of property and limited judicial independence.

**Religious Law Systems**

Religious law systems use sacred texts as primary legal sources and may govern wide areas of life. Major religions have legal traditions; Islamic law (Sharia) with Fiqh is the most widely used religious legal system. Most countries using religious law supplement, rather than replace, their secular legal systems; pure theocracies are rare.

**Customary Law Systems**

Customary systems center authority in monarchs or tribal leaders, granting specific legal powers and often placing rulers above the law. These systems are increasingly uncommon and many monarchies have transitioned to hybrid systems.

**Hybrid Law Systems**

Hybrid systems combine elements of two or more legal traditions. India exemplifies a hybrid system combining common law precedent, civil law-style codes, and religious personal laws for different communities.
