<summary>How Annotations Work in This Sourcebook</summary>

The sourcebook's text includes many annotations, which are indicated by text with a dotted underline like this: This text is annotated. To read the annotation, hover (mouse) over the underlined text. A bubble will appear and display the annotation. (If the bubble does not appear when hovering, then click/tap it.) These annotations provide additional context and information while also decluttering the main reading area.

Also, many references and citations to original source content are located in these annotations, instead of traditional footnotes or endnotes.
